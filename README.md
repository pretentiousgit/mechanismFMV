# Mechanism

This is a display face for the screenPerfect multi-screen FMV engine. It serves serves paired client-control video via a NodeJS server installation to Chrome on desktop, and Android 4.1+ devices. This will also work on iOS, in which case you will need to supply it with *.webm video.

### Documentation

Mechanism is intended to be a complete project, which means that it is a mess intended to display privately.

### Contributing

Please go to http://www.github.com/jennie/iv and contribute to that instead. It's much more solid than this, which is basically a chat client modified to serve linked video files in private.

### Possible Directions

All anyone wants from this is to hook it to Vimeo. There's your next startup idea. Make a random awesome-video-selector for Vimeo.
